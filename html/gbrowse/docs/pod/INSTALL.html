<p>GBrowse is distributed as binary packages for Windows and Macintosh OS
X, and as source code for Unix systems.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="1__windows_install">1. WINDOWS INSTALL</a></h2>
<p>Before installing on Windows systems, you will need to install
ActiveState Perl and the Apache web server.  You may also wish to
install a database management system such as MySQL.</p>

Go to <a href="http://www.activestate.com,">http://www.activestate.com,</a> and download the product
``ActivePerl.''  This is a little confusing because web site tries to
point you to the commercial product, ASPN Perl.  At the current time,

Go to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql</a> .  Select and download the
most recent version of the Windows package.  Once the package is
downloaded, you will need to unpack it with the WinZip program.  Then
launch the installer.  Note that there have been problems reported
with MySQL 4.1, therefore I suggest the newest release of 4.0.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_install_gbrowse">Install GBrowse</a></strong><br />

<dd>
Apache and ActiveState Perl must be installed before you try this
step.  Launch the Windows command shell by choosing ``Run...'' and then
typing ``cmd''.  Once the command shell appears, type the following

<dd>
<p>The binary distribution of GBrowse is at <a href="http://www.gmod.org/ggb/ppm">http://www.gmod.org/ggb/ppm</a>.
Add this repository to the list of active repositories, and then move the
repository to the top to ensure that you get the most up to date versions
of the modules.</p>

<dd>
<p>If you wish to use a MySQL database, install DBD::mysql if you have
not already done so.  Then install Generic-Genome-Browser.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>At the end of the install, the automatic installation script will ask
you to confirm the locations of your Apache conf (configuration),
htdocs (document root) and cgi-bin (CGI executable)
directories. Usually it will guess right, but if it doesn't, just type
in the correct path.</p>

<p>Details:</p>
<p>The browser consists of a CGI script named ``gbrowse'', a Perl module
that handles some of the gory details, a small number of static image
files, and a configuration directory that contains configuration files
for each data source.  By default, these will be installed in the
following locations:</p>
<pre>
   CGI script:      /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gbrowse
   Static images:   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse
   Config files:    /usr/local/apache/conf/gbrowse.conf
   The module:      -standard site-specific Perl library location-</pre>
<p>You can change change the location of the installation by passing
Makefile.PL one or more NAME=VALUE pairs, like so:</p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL CONF=/etc HTDOCS=/home/html</pre>
<p>This will cause the configuration files to be installed in
/etc/gbrowse.conf and the static files to be installed in
/home/html/gbrowse.</p>
<p>The following arguments are recognized:</p>
<pre>
   CONF            Configuration file directory
   HTDOCS          Static files directory
   CGIBIN          CGI script directory
   APACHE          Base directory for Apache's conf, htdocs and cgibin directories
   LIB             Perl site-specific modules directory
   BIN             Perl executable scripts directory
   NONROOT         If set to a non-zero value (e.g. NONROOT=1) then install
                      gbrowse in a way that does not require root access.
   DO_XS           Compile fast alignment algorithm (XS C extension)</pre>
<p>For example, if you are on a RedHat system, where the default Apache
installation uses /var/www/html for HTML files, /var/www/cgi-bin for
CGI scripts, and /etc/httpd/conf for the configuration files, you
should specify the following configuration:</p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL HTDOCS=/var/www/html \
                   CONF=/etc/httpd/conf \
                   CGIBIN=/var/www/cgi-bin</pre>
<p>(The backslashes are there to split the command across multiple lines
only). To make it easier when upgrading to new versions of the
software, you can put this command into a shell script.</p>
<p>As a convenience, you can use the configuration option APACHE, in
which case the static and CGI files will be placed into APACHE/conf,
APACHE/htdocs and APACHE/cgi-bin respectively, where APACHE is the
location you specified on the command line:</p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL APACHE=/home/www</pre>
<p>Note that the configuration files are always placed in a subdirectory
named gbrowse.conf.  You cannot change this.  Similarly, the static
files are placed in a directory named gbrowse.  The install script
will detect if there are already configuration files in the selected
directory and not overwrite them if so.  The same applies to the
cascading stylesheet file (gbrowse.css) located in the gbrowse
subdirectory.  However, neither the GIF files in the ``buttons''
subdirectory nor the plugin modules in the gbrowse.conf/plugins
directory are checked before overwriting them, so be careful to copy
the new copies somewhere safe if you have modified them.</p>
<p>The DO_XS flag, if true (perl Makefile.PL DO_XS=1), will compile a
small C subroutine for nucleotide alignments.  This will vastly improve
the performance of the gbrowse_details script when displaying alignments.
To use this feature, you will need a C compiler.</p>
<p>You can always manually move the files around after install.  See
<a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//CONFIGURE_HOWTO.html">the CONFIGURE_HOWTO manpage</a> for details.</p>
<p>When installing the static files, the install script also creates an
empty directory named ``tmp''.  This directory is set to be world
writable so that the GBrowse server can use it to manage temporary image
files that it creates on the fly.  If you would prefer not to have a
world writable directory on your system, simply change the ownership
and permissions to allow the web server account to write into it.  The
directory is located in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/tmp by
default.</p>
<p>The first time you run Makefile.PL, a file named GGB.def will be
created your file path settings.  When Makefile.PL is run again, it
will ask you whether you wish to reuse the settings stored in the file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="4__installing_into_your_home_directory">4. INSTALLING INTO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY</a></h2>
<p>Read this section only if you are on a Unix system and do not have
root privileges. You will need to configure Apache to run out of your
home directory.  One way to do this is to install Apache from source
code and to specify your home directory when you first configure it:</p>
<pre>
   % cd apache_x.xx.xx
   % ./configure --prefix=$HOME/apache
   % make
   % make install</pre>
<p>This will place Apache into your home directory under ~/apache.  You
should then edit ~/apache/conf/httpd.conf and replace the directive:</p>
<pre>
  Listen 80</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre>
  Listen 8000</pre>
<p>so that Apache will listen for connections to the unprivileged port
8000 rather than the usual port 80.  If you also see a ``Port 80''
directive, change it to read ``Port 8000.'' You'll now be able to talk
to Apache using URLs like <a href="http://your.host.edu:8000/.">http://your.host.edu:8000/.</a></p>
<p>You may not need to install Apache from scratch if your Unix
distribution already has Apache installed.  What you will do is to
create an Apache directory tree in your home directory and then start
Apache using command-line arguments that tell it to start up from the
home directory rather than its default system-wide directory.</p>
<p>Create an Apache directory and its subdirectories using the following
series of commands:</p>
<pre>
  % cd ~
  % mkdir apache
  % mkdir apache/conf
  % mkdir apache/logs
  % mkdir apache/htdocs
  % mkdir apache/cgi-bin</pre>
<p>Now copy the system-wide httpd.conf into ~/apache/conf.  You may need
to search around a bit to find out where the system-wide httpd.conf
lives (try running the command ``locate httpd.conf):</p>
<pre>
  % cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ~/apache/conf</pre>
<p>Now open up ~/apache/conf/httpd.conf with a text editor and add the
following four directives, replacing $HOME with the full path to your
home directory (for example ``/home/fred''):</p>
<pre>
  Listen       8000
  ServerRoot   $HOME/apache
  DocumentRoot $HOME/apache/htdocs
  SetEnv       PERL5LIB $HOME/lib</pre>
<p>You should search the httpd.conf file for older versions of these
directives, and delete them if they're there.  If you see a Port
directive, change it to read ``Port 8000''.</p>
<p>Somewhere in httpd.conf there will be a ScriptAlias directives, as
well as a &lt;Directory&gt; section that refers to ``cgi-bin''.  Delete the
ScriptAlias directive and the entire &lt;Directory&gt; section through to
the &lt;/Directory&gt; line.  Replace both these sections with the
following:</p>
<pre>
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ &quot;cgi-bin/&quot;</pre>
<pre>
 &lt;Location &quot;/cgi-bin&quot;&gt;
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
 &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>You can now start Apache from the command line using the ``apachectl''
script:</p>
<pre>
 % /usr/sbin/apachectl -d ~/apache -k start</pre>
<p>If Apache starts successfully, then this command will return silently.
Otherwise, it will print an error message.  More error messages may be
found in ~/apache/logs/error_log.</p>
<p>To confirm that Apache is running from your home directory, create a
file named index.html and copy it into ~/apache/htdocs.  You should
then be able to open a browser, connect to <a href="http://localhost:8000/,">http://localhost:8000/,</a> and
see the index.html file that you just created.</p>
<p>Now you can build and install gbrowse with the following incantation:</p>
<pre>
 % cd Generic-Genome-Browser-X.XX
 % perl Makefile.PL APACHE=~/apache LIB=~/lib BIN=~/bin NONROOT=1
 % make
 % make install</pre>
<p>When you are prompted to load gbrowse using <a href="http://localhost/gbrowse,">http://localhost/gbrowse,</a>
use <a href="http://localhost:8000/gbrowse">http://localhost:8000/gbrowse</a> instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="5__try_the_browser_out">5. TRY THE BROWSER OUT</a></h2>
<p>The installation procedure will create a small in-memory database of
yeast chromosome 1 for you to play with.  To try the browser out, use
your favorite browser to open:
</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse">http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse</a></pre>
<p>Try searching for ``I'' (the name of the first chromosome of yeast), or
a gene such as NUT21 or TCF3.  Then try searching for ``membrane
trafficking.''</p>
<p>For your interest, the feature and DNA files for this database is
located in the web server's document root at
gbrowse/databases/yeast_chr1.  The configuration file is in the web
server's configuration directory under gbrowse.conf/yeast1.conf.</p>
<p>More configuration information and a short tutorial are located at:</p>
<pre>
   <a href="http://localhost/gbrowse">http://localhost/gbrowse</a></pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="6__populating_the_database__mysql_">6. POPULATING THE DATABASE (MySQL)</a></h2>
<p>This step takes you through populating the database with the full
yeast genome.  You can skip this step if you use the in-memory
database for small projects (see section 6).</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<pre>
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'create database yeast'</pre>
<pre>
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant all privileges on yeast.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant file on *.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant select on yeast.* to nobody@localhost'</pre>
<pre>
  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast sample_data/yeast_data.gff
  make test</pre>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>Note for RedHat Linux users: note that if you are using the default installed
Apache, the user that apache runs as is 'apache' as opposed to the otherwise
standard 'nobody'.  Therefore, everywhere 'nobody' occurs in these directions,
replace it with 'apache'.</p>
<p>In Bioperl versions 1.3 or later (not released as of August 2003),
this script is named bp_bulk_load_gff.pl.</p>
<p>You will need a MySQL database in order to start using GBrowse.  Using the
mysql command line, create a database (called ``yeast'' in the synopsis
above), and ensure that you have update and file privileges on it.
The example above assumes that you have a username of ``me'' and that
you will allow updates from the local machine only.  It also gives all
privileges to ``me''.  You may be comfortable with a more restricted set
of privileges, but be sure to provide at least SELECT, UPDATE and
INSERT privileges.  You will need to provide the administrator's name
and correct password for these commands to succeed.</p>
<p>In addition, grant the ``nobody'' user the SELECT privilege.  The web
server usually runs as nobody, and must be able to make queries on the
database.  Modify this as needed if the web server runs under a
different account.</p>
<p>The next step is to load the database with data.  This is accomplished
by loading the database from a tab-delimited file containing the
genomic annotations in GFF format.  The Bioperl distribution comes
with three tools for loading Bio::DB::GFF databases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_bp_load_gff_2epl">bp_load_gff.pl</a></strong><br />
</li>
This will incrementally load a database, optionally initializing
it if it does not already exist.  This script will work correctly
even if the MySQL server is located on another host.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_bp_bulk_load_gff_2epl">bp_bulk_load_gff.pl</a></strong><br />
</li>
This Perl script will initialize a new Bio::DB::GFF database with
a fresh schema, deleting anything that was there before.  It will
then load the file.  Only suitable for use the very first time
you create a database, or when you want to start from scratch!
The bulk loader is as much as 10x faster than bp_load_gff.pl, but
does not work in the situation in which the MySQL database

This will incrementally load a database.  On UNIX systems, it will
activate a fast loader that makes the speed almost the same as
the bulk loader.  Be careful, though, because this is an experimental
piece of software.
<p></p></ol>
<p>You will find these scripts in the Bioperl distribution, in the
subdirectory scripts/Bio-DB-GFF.  Earlier versions of the
distribution will have these files directly in the scripts/
subdirectory.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, this distribution includes a GFF file with yeast
genome annotations.  The file can be found in the test_data
subdirectory.  If the load is successful, you should see a message
indicating that 13298 features were successfully loaded.</p>
<p>Provided that the yeast load was successful, you may now run ``make
test''.  This invokes a small test script that tests that the database
is accessible by the ``nobody'' user and that the basic feature
retrieval functions are working.</p>
<p>You may also wish to load the yeast DNA, so that you can test the
three-frame translation and GC content features of the browser.
Because of its size, the file containing the complete yeast genome is
distributed separately and can be downloaded from:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gmod/yeast.fasta.gz?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gmod/yeast.fasta.gz?download</a></pre>
<p>Load the file with this command:</p>
<pre>
  bp_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fasta.gz &lt;/dev/null</pre>
<p>(or, if you are on a windows system:</p>
<pre>
  bp_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fasta.gz</pre>
<p>and hit ^Z when the script pauses.)</p>
<p>You should now be able to browse the yeast genome.  Type the following
URL into your favorite browser:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast">http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast</a></pre>
<p>This will display the genome browser instructions and a search field.
Type in ``III'' to start searching chromosome III, or search for
``glucose'' to find a bunch of genes that are involved in glucose
metabolism.</p>
<p>*IF YOU GET AN ERROR* examine the Apache server error log (depending
on how Apache was installed, it may be located in
/usr/local/apache/logs/, /var/log/httpd/, /var/log/apache, or
elsewhere).  Usually there will be an informative error message in the
error log.  The most common problem is MySQL password or permissions
problems.</p>

<h2><a name="7__loading_other_data_sets">7. LOADING OTHER DATA SETS</a></h2>
<p>Genome feature tables for the major model organisms and human can be
found at www.gmod.org in the downloads section, but these files are
not guaranteed to be up to date.</p>
<p>Each model organism database has its own flat file format for
representing the data.  For the most up to date information, you
should download these files and process them into GFF format.
Currently, all of the model organism databases require some tweaking
of the flat files, but the bioperl distribution includes several small
perl scripts to make this easier.  These scripts are optionally
installed when you install Bioperl.  You'll find them in the bioperl
scripts/Bio-DB-GFF directory if you didn't install them directly.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<pre>
  process_gadfly.pl     For FlyBase D. melanogaster flat files
  process_sgd.pl        For SGD S. cerevisiae flat files
  process_wormbase.pl   For WormBase C. elegans flat files</pre>
<p>In Bioperl 1.3, these scripts are named bp_process_gadfly.pl, and so forth.</p>
<p>Run the script with the -h option to get some data-specific help:</p>
<pre>
  % process_gadfly.pl -h</pre>
<p>The bp_process_wormbase.pl script requires the AcePerl package, which
is available from CPAN.  It is not strictly necessary to run this
script because the unaltered GFF files distributed from WormBase are
compatible with GBrowse.  process_wormbase.pl supplements the
information with the physical positions of genetic markers, GenBank
accession numbers and functional descriptions of gene products.</p>
<p>For configuration files that will work with each of these databases,
look in contrib/conf_files (or in
<a href="http://localhost/gbrowse/contrib/conf_files).">http://localhost/gbrowse/contrib/conf_files).</a>  Simply copy the
appropriate configuration file into your gbrowse.conf directory, and
edit the database name as appropriate.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in the load_genbank.pl script, which is
installed when you install GBrowse.  You can give this script a list
of Genbank or EMBL accession numbers and it will automatically
download the indicated entries and load them into a MySQL
database. You can also load flat files in Genbank or EMBL format.</p>
<p>The sample configuration file 08.genbank.conf (located in
contrib/conf_files) is appropriate for data loaded with
load_genbank.pl.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="8__loading_dna">8. LOADING DNA</a></h2>
<p>To display the DNA sequence and to run sequence-dependent glyphs such
as the three-frame translation, you will need to load the DNA as well
as the annotations.  The DNA must be formatted as a series of one or
more FASTA-format files in which each entry in the file corresponds to
a top-level sequence such as a chromosome pseudomolecule.  You can
then run the bp_load_gff.pl or bp_bulk_load_gff.pl script using the -fasta
argument.  For example, if the yeast genome is contained in a FASTA
file named yeast.fa, you would run the command:</p>
<pre>
  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fa sample/yeast_data.gff</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you may put several FASTA files into a directory, and
provide the directory name as the argument to -fasta.</p>
<p>(The yeast DNA is too large to be included in this distribution, but
you can get a copy of it from
<a href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/)">ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/)</a></p>
<p>Run ``bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -h'' to see usage instructions.</p>
<pre>
                                                                                
Newer versions of GFF (the so-called &quot;GFF2.5&quot; and &quot;GFF3&quot; formats) include
the DNA at the bottom of the file, following the sequence annotations.
If you are loading one of these GFF files, the DNA will be recognized
automatically and loaded by any of the loaders.</pre>
<p>

<h2><a name="9__creating_your_own_genome_database">9. CREATING YOUR OWN GENOME DATABASE</a></h2>
<p>See the file doc/pod/CONFIGURE_HOWTO.pod for information on how to
create new databases from scratch, add new browser tracks, and how to
get the browser to dump the DNA from the region currently under
display.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="10__making_the_browser_run_faster">10. MAKING THE BROWSER RUN FASTER</a></h2>
<p>Three factors are major contributors to the length of time it takes to
load a gbrowse page:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
Loading the Perl interpreter and parsing BioPerl and all the 
other Perl libraries that gbrowse uses.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Query speed on the database
<p></p>
<li></li>
The conversion at the Perl layer of database data into BioPerl
objects for rendering.
<p></p></ol>
<p>To improve (1), I recommend that you install the mod_perl module for
Apache. (<a href="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</a>).  By configuring an Apache::Registry
directory and placing gbrowse inside it (rather than in the default
cgi-bin directory). The overhead for loading Perl and its libraries
are eliminated, thereby increasing the performance of the script
noticeably.</p>
<p>Be aware that there is a bad interaction between the Apache::DBI
module (often used to speed up database accesses) and Bio::DB::GFF.
This will cause the GFF dumper plugin to fail intermittently.  GBrowse
does not need Apache::DBI to achieve performance increases under
mod_perl and it is suggested that you disable Apache::DBI.  If you
cannot do this, then you should remove the file GFFDumper.pm from the
gbrowse.conf/plugins directory.</p>
<p>Database query performance (2) is also a major factor.  If you are
using MySQL as the backend, you will see dramatic performance
increases by increasing the amount of memory available to the key
buffer, sort buffer, table cache and other in-memory data structures.
I suggest that you replace the default MySQL configuration file
(usually stored in /etc/my.cnf) with one of the large-memory sample
configuration files provided in the support-files subdirectory of the
MySQL distribution.  Of course, if you tell MySQL to use more memory
than you have, then performance will degrade again.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a slowdown when gbrowse converts the results of
database SQL queries into renderable biological objects.  This becomes
particularly noticeable when there are lots of multi-segment objects
to be displayed.  You can work around this slowdown by using semantic
zooming (see <a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//CONFIGURE_HOWTO.html">the CONFIGURE_HOWTO manpage</a>).  Otherwise, there's not much
that can be done about this short of buying a faster machine.
The GMOD team is working hard to reduce this performance hit.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="11__making_the_server_run_safer">11. MAKING THE SERVER RUN SAFER</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you are running a server-side Web script using information
provided by a web client, there is a risk that maliciously-formatted
data provided by the use will trick the server-side script into
performing some unintentional action, such as modifying a file on the
server.  Perl's ``taint'' checks are designed to catch places in the
code where such malicious data could cause harm, and GBrowse has been
tested extensively with these taint checks activated.</p>
<p>Because of taint checks' noticeable impact on performance, they have
been turned off in the distributed version of gbrowse.  If you wish to
reactivate the extra checking (at the expense of a performance hit),
go to the file ``gbrowse'' located in the Web scripts directory and edit
the top line of the file to read:</p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T</pre>
<p>The -T switch turns on taint checks.</p>
<p>If you are running GBrowse under mod_perl, add the following line to
the httpd.conf configuration file:</p>
<pre>
  PerlTaintCheck  On</pre>
<p>This will affect all mod_perl scripts globally.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="12__bioperl_versions">12. BIOPERL VERSIONS</a></h2>
<p>GBrowse is evolving quickly, and some of its features are dependent on
new features in Bioperl 1.4.0.  If you are having trouble making
GBrowse run, make sure you are using Bioperl 1.4.0!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="13__the_gbrowse_img_script">13. THE GBROWSE_IMG SCRIPT</a></h2>
<p>The gbrowse_img CGI script (a new feature as of version 1.41), is a
stripped-down version of gbrowse which just generates images.  It is
suitable for incorporating into &lt;img&gt; tags in order to make a
thumbnail of a region of interest.  The thumbnail can then be linked
to the full-featured gbrowse.  Here is an example of how this works
using the WormBase site:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=mec-3">http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=mec-3</a>&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse_img/wormbase?name=mec-3;width=200">http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse_img/wormbase?name=mec-3;width=200</a>&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>This will generate a 200-pixel inline image of the region.  Clicking
on the image will link to the fully-navigable gbrowse script.</p>
<p>You can also use gbrowse_img to superimpose temporary features (like
BLAST hits) on the existing genome features.</p>
<p>Read docs/gbrowse_img.txt <strong>DOES NOT EXIST</strong> for the CGI parameters and other
instructions. A copy of these instructions in HTML form will be
generated when gbrowse_img is called without any arguments.  Type
<a href="http://your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img">http://your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img</a> into your favorite web browser.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="14__plugins">14. PLUGINS</a></h2>
<p>Gbrowse has a plugin architecture which makes it easy for third-party
developers to expand its functionality.  The plugins are Perl .pm
files located in the directory gbrowse.conf/plugins/.  To install
plugins, simply copy them into this directory.  To uninstall, remove
them.</p>
<p>If you wish to install your own or third party plugins, it is
suggested that you create a separate directory outside the
gbrowse.conf/ hierarchy in which to store them and then to indicate
the location of these plugins using the plugin_path setting:</p>
<pre>
  plugin_path = /usr/local/gbrowse_plugins</pre>
<p>This setting should be somewhere in the [GENERAL] section of the
relevant gbrowse configuration file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="15__the_genbank_embl_proxy">15. THE GENBANK/EMBL PROXY</a></h2>
<p>Sample configuration number 5 (``05.embl.conf'') corresponds to an
experimental pass-through proxy for Genbank.  At least in theory, if
you enter a landmark that isn't recognized, gbrowse will go to EMBL
using the bioperl BioFetch facility, parse the record, and enter it
into the local database.  This allows you to browse arbitrary
Genbank/EMBL/Refseq entries.</p>
<p>You are free to experiment with this, but don't expect it to be
entirely reliable.  To get it to work, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
Make sure you are using Bioperl 1.02 (or a patched version of 1.01)
<p></p>
<li></li>
Create a local database named ``embl'' and initialize it this way:
<p></p>
<li></li>
Set up permissions for this database so that ``nobody@localhost'' has
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges
<p></p>
<li></li>
Initialize the database for use with this command:
<pre>
  % bp_load_gff.pl -c -d embl &lt;/dev/null</pre>
<p>(if you are on a windows system, just leave out the &lt;/dev/null)</p>
<p></p>
<li></li>
If you need to use a proxy to access remote web sites, uncomment the
-proxy line in the conf file, and adjust the URL of the proxy as appropriate.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Go to <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/embl.">http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/embl.</a>
Search for a Genbank or embl accession number, such as CEF58D5
<p></p></ol>

<h2><a name="16__updating_the_browser_without_reentering_your_directory_settings">16. UPDATING THE BROWSER WITHOUT REENTERING YOUR DIRECTORY SETTINGS</a></h2>
<p>When updating GBrowse to a new version of the software, you can
configure it using your preferred directory settings by making a
backup copy of the file GGB.def that was generated the first time you
installed GBrowse and using `cat GGB.def` as the argument to
Makefile.PL.  Here is the recipe:</p>
<pre>
  cp Generic-Genome-Browser-1.40/GGB.def Generic-Genome-Browser-1.41/GGB.def
  cd Generic-Genome-Browser-1.41/
  perl Makefile.PL `cat GGB.def`
  make
  make install</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="17__removing_outofdate_image_files">17. REMOVING OUT-OF-DATE IMAGE FILES</a></h2>
<p>As GBrowse runs, it creates temporary image files in the gbrowse tmp
directory (typically /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/tmp).  These
image files are relatively small, but if you run GBrowse for a long
time they may begin consuming significant amounts of disk space.
The following Unix shell commands will remove old image files:</p>
<pre>
  cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/tmp
  find . -type f -atime +20 -print -exec rm {} \;</pre>
<p>You might want to run this command under cron, but be aware that
since the image files are owned by user ``nobody'', you must install
this command in the cron script for ``nobody'' or ``root.''</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="18__known_bugs">18. KNOWN BUGS</a></h2>
<p>Currently there is one known bug.  The navigation buttons do not
operate properly when the client is using Internet Explorer 5.1 on a
Macintosh and accessing gbrowse running on a MacOS X server running
Apache.  Other combinations of clients and servers work properly.</p>
